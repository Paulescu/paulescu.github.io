As I browse the internet looking for machine learning stuff, I quite often find myself either in
- either Logistic regression
- or BERT!...

Understanding the nuts-and-bolts of state-of-the-art implementations requires a deeper understanding of Tensorflow. By having a deeper understanding of Tensorflow you will be able to actually understand the implementations of the latest networkds (e.g. Transformer, BERT, FPN...)
